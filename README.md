# Image-colorization
This project uses **OpenCVâ€™s DNN module** with a **Caffe-based deep learning model** by **Richard Zhang et al.** for **black-and-white image colorization**. The model predicts missing **AB color channels** in the **LAB color space** and converts them to **RGB**. **Streamlit** provides an interactive UI.
